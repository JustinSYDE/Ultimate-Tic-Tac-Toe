A GUI version of the traditional 3x3 Tic Tac Toe and 4x4 Tic Tac Toe game made in Java with Swing library.
Users can play with a friend or play against the computer.

Player 1 is represented with a 'X' symbol:
 
	1) 'X' always has the first move.
  
Player 2 or the computer is represented with a 'O' symbol.
 
	1) 'O' always has the second move.

Instructions to run the program:

Step 1. Run TicTacToeGUI.jar in the dist folder

Step 2. Select whether to play 3x3 or 4x4 and Single or Double.

	1) Note: in 4x4, traditional rules still apply - first to 3 in a row wins!
